# LooplessFluxSampler
Toolbox for performing loopless flux sampling analysis of large-scale metabolic models using the Adaptive Direction Sampling on a Box (ADSB) algorithm. This toolbox requires COBRA v3.0 to be installed to run properly.

This softfware is part of the following scientific publication:
Saa PA, Zapararte S, Drovandi CC, Nielsen LK. LooplessFluxSampler: An efficient algorithm for sampling the loopless flux solution space of metabolic models. BMC Bioinformatics. 25: 3. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-023-05616-2

Requirements
- COBRA Toolbox v3.0 (https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox)
- Parallel Computing Toolbox (only necessary for parallel sampling)
